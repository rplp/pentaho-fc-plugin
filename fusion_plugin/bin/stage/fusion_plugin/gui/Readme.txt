FusionMaps GUI
--------------

Please copy this folder and Maps folder to a server (either localhost or remote) for the GUI
to work properly. When running from local file system, the GUI would NOT work, as Flash Player
blocks Flash to JavaScript communication, which is essential for this GUI to work.

Or, you can add this folder as a trusted folder in the interface at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html
